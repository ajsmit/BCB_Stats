## Introduction

If the research question involves understanding, quantifying, or predicting the relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables, then regression-based methods would be more appropriate. Regression models allow for estimating the effect of predictors on the response variable, assessing the strength and significance of the relationships, making predictions or forecasts based on the predictor values, and exploring linear and non-linear relationships while handling different types of response variables.

## Regression decision diagram

### 1. Start with the Research Question and Data Characteristics

* What is the nature of your response/dependent variable?
    - Continuous: Proceed to Linear Models (Section 2) or Non-Linear Models (Section 5) if linearity assumption is violated.
    - Binary (Yes/No): Consider Logistic Regression (Section 3).
    - Count data: Explore Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) (Section 4).
    - Proportions or percentages: Consider Beta Regression (Section 4).
* Are you interested in prediction, explanation, or simply assessing the strength of a relationship?
    - Prediction: Linear, generalised linear, and non-linear models are suitable.
    - Explanation: Consider models that allow for interpretation of coefficients and relationships.
    - Strength of relationship: Correlation (Section 7), linear, and generalised linear models can be used.

### 2. Linear Models for Continuous Outcomes

Linear models assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the continuous response variable.

#### 2.1. Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

- **R Function:** `lm()`
- **Data Requirements:** Continuous outcome, one continuous predictor.
- **Assumptions:** Normality, homoscedasticity of residuals, linearity.
- **Diagnostics:** Check residual plots, normality of residuals, and leverage/influence points.
- **If Assumptions Fail:** Transformations (e.g., log, square root), robust regression (`rlm()` in MASS package), or consider non-linear models (Section 5).

The following aspects to be included:

**Model Validation and Selection:** Introduce techniques for model validation, such as cross-validation or bootstrapping, to assess how well the model generalizes to new data. Discuss criteria for model selection, like adjusted R-squared or information criteria (AIC, BIC), to compare different models and choose the most appropriate one.

**Outliers and Influential Points:** Explain how to identify outliers and influential points using diagnostic plots (e.g., Cook's distance) or statistical tests. Discuss strategies for dealing with these points, such as robust regression or data transformation, and the potential impact on model results.

**Practical Considerations:** Provide guidance on experimental design for simple linear regression, including sample size determination, choice of predictor variables, and potential confounding factors. Discuss the importance of domain knowledge in interpreting regression results and making informed decisions based on the model.

**Extensions and Limitations:** Briefly mention extensions of simple linear regression, such as weighted least squares for heteroscedasticity or segmented regression for non-linear relationships. Discuss the limitations of simple linear regression, emphasizing the importance of checking assumptions and considering alternative models when necessary.


#### 2.2. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

- **R Function:** `lm()`
- **Data Requirements:** Continuous outcome, multiple predictors (continuous or categorical).
- **Assumptions:** Same as SLR, plus no multicollinearity.
